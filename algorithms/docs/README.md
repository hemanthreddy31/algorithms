# Algorithms Notes Index

This docs folder contains topic-wise READMEs for advanced algorithms. Each page includes definitions, intuition, pseudocode, complexity, pitfalls, and best practices.

## Topics
- [Foundations](foundations/README.md)
- [Sorting Algorithms](sorting/README.md)
- [Searching Algorithms](searching/README.md)
- [Data Structures & Related Algorithms](data-structures/README.md)
- [Graph Algorithms](graph-algorithms/README.md)
- [Dynamic Programming](dynamic-programming/README.md)
- [Greedy Algorithms](greedy-algorithms/README.md)
- [Divide & Conquer](divide-and-conquer/README.md)
- [Backtracking](backtracking/README.md)
- [String Algorithms](string-algorithms/README.md)
- [Advanced Topics](advanced-topics/README.md)
- [Modern Applications](modern-applications/README.md)

## How to Use
- Start with Foundations for complexity and analysis basics.
- Use topic pages as quick references while studying or implementing.
- Ask for expansions if you want deeper, example-driven walkthroughs.
